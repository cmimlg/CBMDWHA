This repository contains the code and data files for the homogeniety analysis of the airline delay dataset and the synthetic dataset. The data file for the airline delay dataset is "clean_jan_2016_data.csv". The R script, "Homals_Airline_Delay.R" performs the necessary pre-processing of the airline delay data file and uses homogeniety analysis to determine a euclidean representation of the categorical attributes in the dataset. You will need to edit the directory locations in the script to your particular requirements if you run this script. The synthetic dataset, "Syn_Mixed_Data.csv" is generated by running the "gen_data(True)" method of the python script "Synthetic_Unsup.py". The R script, "Homals_Synthetic_Data.R" performs homogeniety analysis on the synthetic data file to determine a euclidean representation of the categorical attributes. You will need to edit the directory locations in this script to your particular requirements if you run this script.
